* COMMENT fsharp

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package fsharp-mode
  :mode "\\.fsx\\'"
  :custom
  (fsharp-tab-always-indent nil)
  :defer t)
#+end_src

Ideally, the following would work:

(add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs `(fsharp-mode . ("fsautocomplete" "--adaptive-lsp-server-enabled")))

Though, things aren't ideal and eglot-fsharp does some helpful work.
So, to prevent attempts to manage the server, overrides are made to a few functions.
Either override is sufficient at time of writing, though I expect fixing the lastest version to installed to be most robust.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package eglot-fsharp
  :after fsharp-mode
  :config
  (setq eglot-fsharp-server-install-dir nil)

  (defun eglot-fsharp--latest-version ()
    ;; Overriden to return the installed version
    (eglot-fsharp--installed-version))
  (defun eglot-fsharp--maybe-install (&optional version)
    ;; Overriden to prevent installation
    nil))
#+end_src
